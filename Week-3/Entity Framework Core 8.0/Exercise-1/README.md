# 🧪 Lab 1: Understanding ORM with a Retail Inventory System

## 📘 Scenario
You're building an inventory management system for a retail store. The store wants to track products, categories, and stock levels in a SQL Server database.

## 🎯 Objective
Understand what **ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)** is and how **Entity Framework Core (EF Core)** helps bridge the gap between C# objects and relational database tables.

---

## 🧠  What is ORM?

ORM maps **C# classes** to **database tables** and allows developers to work with data as strongly typed objects.

### ✅ Benefits of ORM
- **Productivity**: Reduces boilerplate SQL code.
- **Maintainability**: Easier to manage as codebase grows.
- **Abstraction**: Interacts with database through C# code, not SQL.
